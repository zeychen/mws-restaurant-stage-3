# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
## Restaurant Reviews Stage 3
### Project Overview
This project is the continuation of Restaurant Reviews Stage 2 by taking the responsive, accessible, and offline first design built in Stage 1 and 2 and add additional functionalities. There is a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, the form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, the site is optimized to meet performance benchmarks tested using Lighthouse.

## Getting Started

### Development local API Server
_Location of server = /server_
Server depends on [node.js LTS Version: v6.11.2 ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/)
Please make sure you have these installed before proceeding forward.

Great, you are ready to proceed forward; awesome!

Let's start with running commands in your terminal, known as command line interface (CLI)

###### Install Sails.js globally
